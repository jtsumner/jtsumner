Hi, I'm Jack Sumner, a PhD student in the Hartmann Lab at Northwestern University (https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartmann/). I have a background in comparative genomics and sequencing methods. My current goals are to distill factors that drive biological innovation in human microbiomes, specifically the lower respiratory tract microbiome, by first exploring their structure, function, and dynamics.

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or are interested in collaboration.
